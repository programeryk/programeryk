## Hi, I'm Eryk 👋

I'm a computer science student focused on **backend and fullstack development**, mainly using **TypeScript / JavaScript** and **Node.js**.

I’m most interested in how systems behave over time — how backend APIs, business logic, and databases interact, and how to design them so state changes remain predictable and understandable.

---

## 🔭 What I’m working on

- **Backend development** (NestJS, REST, PostgreSQL, Prisma)
- **Stateful systems** (daily check-ins, streaks, rewards, deterministic rules)
- **Frontend when needed** (React, Next.js)
- Clean project structure and predictable behavior

I tend to learn best by building systems that have to “hold together” over time, not just work once.
