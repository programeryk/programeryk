## Hi, I’m Eryk 🌫️

I’m a computer science student focused on **backend and fullstack development**,
mainly working with **TypeScript / JavaScript** and **Node.js**.

What I enjoy most is wiring systems together — APIs, databases, and business logic —
and figuring out how to make them work correctly and predictably over time,
not just “run once”.

I learn by building real projects, breaking them, and improving them until the
structure makes sense.
