## Hi, I’m Eryk 🌫️

I’m a computer science student focused on **backend and fullstack development**,
mainly working with **TypeScript / JavaScript** and **Node.js**.

What I enjoy most is wiring systems together and getting lost in code until it clicks.
I also have a passion for aesthetics and art, which help in creating 
detailed and pleasing frontend projects.

I learn by building real things, breaking them, and improving them until the
structure makes sense.
